# build-my-world

This is the first project in a set of projects within the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program. A Gazebo world is built with a set of models created using the building editor tool and model editor tool, and exported from the Gazebo online library. Subsequently, the C++ world plugin is used to interact with the the world that's created.
